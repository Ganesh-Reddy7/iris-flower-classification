# Iris Flower Classification Project

The Iris Flower Classification Project is a machine learning project that aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements. It uses the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features for 150 Iris flowers belonging to three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The project's main objective is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its petal and sepal measurements. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance. Various classification algorithms and techniques can be explored to achieve the best accuracy and generalization.

Who is it for?
- Students and Enthusiasts: The project is suitable for students and machine learning enthusiasts who want to gain practical experience in building a classification model from scratch. It provides an opportunity to apply various machine learning techniques and evaluation metrics to a real-world dataset.
- Beginners in Machine Learning: The Iris Flower Classification Project is an excellent starting point for beginners in machine learning. It introduces the fundamental concepts of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a straightforward and easy-to-understand manner.
- Data Scientists and Practitioners: For data scientists and practitioners, this project can serve as a quick and simple example to demonstrate classification techniques to stakeholders or as a baseline comparison for more complex classification tasks in their domain.
- Researchers and Educators: The Iris dataset is a classic and well-documented dataset, making it a valuable resource for researchers and educators to use in tutorials, demonstrations, or experiments related to classification algorithms and techniques.

In summary, the Iris Flower Classification Project provides a practical and educational opportunity to work on a simple but classic machine learning problem. It serves as a stepping stone for learners and practitioners to dive into more sophisticated classification projects and explore various advanced techniques in the field of machine learning.


## Demo

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository from GitHub.

2.Install the required dependencies using pip

3.Open the jupyter application

4.If jupyter is not available then install the anaconda and set up it.Then you will get the jupyter application.

5.After opening the jupyter you will be directed into the default browser.

6.Now go to the location where where you have placed the project by following the directory.

8.Now find the nextword iris_flower_classification.ipnyb file and then run it.

9.Now you need to execute the each segment to complete the execution of the project.

There you can analyse the outputs

10.The dataset that is used in this project is

    1.IRIS.csv



## Appendix

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of 5 features for 150 Iris flowers of three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The five features are:

Sepal Length (in centimeters)

Sepal Width (in centimeters)

Petal Length (in centimeters)

Petal Width (in centimeters)

species 

The dataset is available in the IRIS.csv file.
